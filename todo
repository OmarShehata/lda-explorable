* Create 2D projection, with a plane that rotates in 4 dimensions.
	* Make updateRotation function that runs when input changes or when you press on keyboard
	* Make that function just apply a rotor, and store that somewhere
	* Apply that rotor onto the basis, project data on that basis
	* Get the inverse of that rotor ????

* Use LDA to find separation for 4D data. Hide some good structure in it

* Dynamic formula text with diagram. 
* Put example on Colaboratory
