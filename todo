* Apply LDA to get this line of separation. 
* Recreate JS interface with 3D to 2D instead. 
* Come up with 3D Data for that.
* Figure out how to use LDA to compute this? 
* Come up with 4D data.
	* Use LDA to find separation for 4D data. Hide some good structure in it
* Figure out how to project 4D data down. 
* Dynamic formula text with diagram. 
* Put example on Colaboratory
