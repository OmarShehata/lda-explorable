* Use LDA to find best separation for 3D data
* Create a link that you click on that gives you the best plane. 

* Come up with 4D data.
* Create a figure for it. Init 2D grid 
* Create 2D projection, with a plane that rotates in 4 dimensions.
* Show all 6 angles. 
* Use LDA to find separation for 4D data. Hide some good structure in it

* Dynamic formula text with diagram. 
* Put example on Colaboratory 

* Add reference to LDA facial rec paper, as a link to the bottom, that takes you back up
