* Create JS interface of 2D data, gets projected onto a 1D line, line can be rotated with mouse.
* Put together a data set that is not separable on horizontal or vertical.
* Load this dataset automatically into the graph including the headers.
* Apply LDA to get this line of separation. 
* Recreate JS interface with 3D to 2D instead. 
* Come up with 3D Data for that.
* Figure out how to use LDA to compute this? 
* Come up with 4D data.
	* Use LDA to find separation for 4D data. Hide some good structure in it
* Figure out how to project 4D data down. 
* Dynamic formula text with diagram. 
* Put example on Colaboratory
